"""
Per-Event adaptive integration.

These tools are for integrating the adaptive logic inside of a run.
They are expected to get single events and provide feedback to drive
the plan based in that information.  This is useful when the computation
time to make the decision is short compared to acquisition / movement time
and the computation is amenable to streaming analysis.

This is a "fine" grained integration of the adaptive logic into data acquisition.

    """
    Generate the callback and queue for recommender agent integration.

    For each Event that the callback sees it will place either a
    recommendation, `None`, or Exception for the Run Engine into the queue.
    Recommendations will be of a dict mapping the independent_keys to the recommended values and
    should be interpreted by the plan as a request for more data.  A `None`
    placed in the queue should be interpreted by the plan as in instruction to terminate the run.
    An `Exception` placed in the queue will be raised by the plan.


    Parameters
    ----------
    recommender : object
        The recommendation agent object with ask/tell interface

    independent_keys : List[str]
        The names of the independent keys in the events

    dependent_keys : List[str]
        The names of the dependent keys in the events

    max_count : int, optional
        The maximum number of measurements to take before poisoning the queue.

    queue : Queue, optional
        The communication channel for the callback to feedback to the plan.
        If not given, a new queue will be created.

    Returns
    -------
    callback : Callable[str, dict]
        This function must be subscribed to RunEngine to receive the
        document stream.

    queue : Queue
        The communication channel between the callback and the plan.  This
        is always returned (even if the user passed it in).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dets : List[OphydObj]
       The detector to read at each point.  The dependent keys that the
       recommendation engine is looking for must be provided by these
       devices.

    first_point : Dict[Settable, Any]
       The first point of the scan.  The motors that will be scanned
       are extracted from the keys.  The independent keys that the
       recommendation engine is looking for / returning must be provided
       by these devices.

    to_recommender : Callable[document_name: str, document: dict]
       This is the callback that will be registered to the RunEngine.

       The expected contract is for each event it will place either a
       dict mapping independent variable to recommended value or None.

       This plan will either move to the new position and take data
       if the value is a dict or end the run if `None`

    from_recommender : Queue
       The consumer side of the Queue that the recommendation engine is
       putting the recommendations onto.

    md : dict[str, Any], optional
       Any extra meta-data to put in the Start document
