"""
Per-Start adaptive integration.

These functions are for integrating adaptive logic that works
between runs.  The decision making process can expect to consume a
full run before having to make a recommendation about what to do next.
This may be desirable if there is a major time miss-match between the
computation and the experiment, of the data collection is not amenable
to streaming analysis, or the natural structure of the experiment
dictates.

This corresponds to a "middle" scale of adaptive integration into
data collection.

):
    """
    Generate the callback and queue for an Adaptive API backed reccomender.

    This recommends a fixed step size independent of the measurement.

    For each Run (aka Start) that the callback sees it will place
    either a recommendation or `None` into the queue.  Recommendations
    will be of a dict mapping the independent_keys to the recommended
    values and should be interpreted by the plan as a request for more
    data.  A `None` placed in the queue should be interpreted by the
    plan as in instruction to terminate the run.

    The StartDocuments in the stream must contain the key
    ``'batch_count'``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    adaptive_object : adaptive.BaseLearner
        The recommendation engine

    independent_keys : List[str]
        The names of the independent keys in the events

    dependent_keys : List[str]
        The names of the dependent keys in the events

    max_count : int, optional
        The maximum number of measurements to take before poisoning the queue.

    queue : Queue, optional
        The communication channel for the callback to feedback to the plan.
        If not given, a new queue will be created.

    Returns
    -------
    callback : Callable[str, dict]
        This function must be subscribed to RunEngine to receive the
        document stream.

    queue : Queue
        The communication channel between the callback and the plan.  This
        is always returned (even if the user passed it in).

    Execute an adaptive scan using an inter-run recommendation engine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dets : List[OphydObj]
       The detector to read at each point.  The dependent keys that the
       recommendation engine is looking for must be provided by these
       devices.

    first_point : Dict[Settable, Any]
       The first point of the scan.  The motors that will be scanned
       are extracted from the keys.  The independent keys that the
       recommendation engine is looking for / returning must be provided
       by these devices.

    to_recommender : Callable[document_name: str, document: dict]
       This is the callback that will be registered to the RunEngine.

       The expected contract is for each event it will place either a
       dict mapping independent variable to recommended value or None.

       This plan will either move to the new position and take data
       if the value is a dict or end the run if `None`

    from_recommender : Queue
       The consumer side of the Queue that the recommendation engine is
       putting the recommendations onto.

    md : dict[str, Any], optional
       Any extra meta-data to put in the Start document

    take_reading : plan, optional
        function to do the actual acquisition ::

        Callable[List[OphydObj], Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] -> Generator[Msg], optional
